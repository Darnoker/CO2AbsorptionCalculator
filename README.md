# CO2 Absorption Calculator
University Group Project under mentoring of Kainos company representative.

The goal of this project is to pass the semester, and create a proof of concept algorithm, that calculates how much CO2 will a forest absorb. As a 2 person project, work is splitted into backend and frontend.

# Contributors

# Backend

Konrad Głąb (@darnoker) will be responsible for backend development in java, using (insert when chosen) framework.

# Frontend

Daniel Knopf (@WoollyAndWooden, potentially also as @dknopf0) will contribute to the frontend side of the app, using javascript with react libraries.

# Branching strategy

DO NOT push to main, unless code is confirmed to work. Branch out with the current code version using branching template of [front][back]end/IssueCurrentlyWorkingOn.
Start commit with [Jira Story number] (For example, [CO2AC-1] and a short description of what was done, then create Pull Request. It is easier to manage changes that way.

Update Readme if neccessary.
